#  Shore Thing Pull Tab Game Closes Out After Only One Player

SHORE THING, NJ - The much anticipated Shore Thing pull tab game has closed its doors after only one player.

The game, which was supposed to last for six weeks, only saw one player make it to the final round. That player, Pete Benson, walked away with the $1,000 prize.

"I'm just glad I could be the one to win," said Benson. "I'm sure the other contestants were just as eager to win as I was."

When asked about what he plans to do with the prize money, Benson said he's going to use it to pay some bills and put some money away for a rainy day.

Despite being a one-player game, Shore Thing generated a lot of excitement in the small town of Shore Thing. Many people were hoping to be the lucky contestant who walked away with the cash prize.

"I'm really disappointed that the game didn't last longer," said Barbara Walters, a local resident. "But I'm glad someone was able to win it."
