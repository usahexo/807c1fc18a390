#  What kind of horror do they depict?

There is a reason that horror movies have been around for as long as they have - they depict a kind of fear that is primal and universal. People love to be scared, and horror movies offer a safe way to experience fear without any real danger. But what kind of horror do they depict?

One type of horror that is popular in movies is the monster movie. These movies often feature creatures that are monstrous and terrifying, such as Godzilla or King Kong. Another popular type of horror movie is the slasher film, which features a killer who murders people in graphic ways. Finally, there are also psychological thrillers, which explore the mind of a serial killer or someone with a mental illness.

Each of these types of horror has its own appeal. Monster movies are exciting because they feature creatures that are larger than life and can pose a real threat to humans. Slasher films are scary because they depict violence in a very realistic way, and often involve protagonists who are vulnerable and unable to escape from the killer. Psychological thrillers are chilling because they explore some of the dark aspects of human psychology and can be very suspenseful.

Ultimately, it is the combination of fear and excitement that makes horror movies so popular. People love to be scared but they also want to feel like they can survive the experience unscathed. Horror movies offer this unique mixture and continue to be one of the most popular movie genres today.

#  Are they all new series?

Netflix has been on a roll lately with its new series. It seems like there's a new show every week and many of them are excellent. But are all of these new series actually new?

Netflix originals have been around for quite a while. The first original show was Lilyhammer which premiered in 2012. However, the number of Netflix originals has exploded in the past few years. In 2015, there were only 29 originals. That number jumped to 55 in 2016 and 116 in 2017. Clearly, Netflix is investing a lot in its original content.

So are all of these new series really new? Not exactly. Many of them are continuations of old series or revivals of older shows. Stranger Things, for example, is a continuation of the 80s classic E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. And Arrested Development is a revival of a show that ended in 2006.

But does that make them any less good? Definitely not. In fact, many of the revivals, like Arrested Development and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, are even better than the original shows. And if you're looking for something completely new, there's always Narcos or House of Cards.

Netflix has definitely upped its game when it comes to original content. With so many great shows to choose from, there's something for everyone. So whatever your taste, Netflix has you covered.
