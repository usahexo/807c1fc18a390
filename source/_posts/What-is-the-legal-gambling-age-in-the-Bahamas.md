#  What is the legal gambling age in the Bahamas?

The legal gambling age in the Bahamas is 18. This is true for all forms of gambling, including casinos, lotteries, and poker. There are some exceptions for those who are 16 or 17 years old, but they must be accompanied by an adult who is at least 21 years old.

The legal gambling age in the Bahamas is one of the lowest in the world. In comparison, the legal gambling age in the United States is 21. There are a few countries with a lower age limit, including Bahrain (18), Paraguay (18), and Lebanon (18).

There are a few reasons for why the Bahamian government set the legal gambling age at 18. The first reason is that the government wanted to protect young people from becoming addicted to gambling. Secondly, the government wanted to ensure that adults were responsible enough to gamble responsibly. Finally, setting a higher age limit could have resulted in less revenue for the government from gambling taxes.
