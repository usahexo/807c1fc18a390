The LA Clippers have announced a new partnership with the sports betting site Spreadex. The agreement will see the Clippers become the first NBA team to work with a spread betting company.

Spreadex CEO Mark Slaney said that he was "thrilled" to be working with the Clippers, adding that the team's "commitment to innovation and fan engagement make them an ideal partner for us."

Under the terms of the deal, Spreadex will become the "official UK and Ireland betting partner" of the Clippers. The two organisations will collaborate on a number of initiatives, including marketing, product development and customer service.

Clippers President of Business Operations Gillian Zucker said that she was "excited" to be partnering with Spreadex, describing it as "a well-respected and innovative company in our industry."

The agreement comes at a time when sports betting is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. In May this year, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited sports betting outside of Nevada. Since then, several states have moved to legalise the activity.

The Clippers are not the only NBA team to get into bed with a spread betting company. In September, the Philadelphia 76ers announced a partnership with Betfair US.
