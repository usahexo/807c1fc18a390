This year, we are expecting even more great horror movies. So, what will be the best horror movies of 2022?

Here are five horror movies that we think will be the best of 2022:

1) "It: Chapter Two"

This movie is a sequel to the 2017 hit "It". It follows the same characters as they confront their biggest fears as adults. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect "It: Chapter Two" to be just as good, if not better.

2) "The Conjuring 3"

The Conjuring series is one of the most successful horror franchises of all time. The first two movies were both box office successes and received critical acclaim. We expect the third movie to be just as good, if not better. It follows Ed and Lorraine Warren as they investigate a case that is based on real-life events.

This movie is a sequel to the 2018 hit "A Quiet Place". It follows the same characters as they try to survive in a world where monsters hunt by sound. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect "A Quiet Place 2" to be just as good, if not better.

4) "Halloween Kills"

This movie is a sequel to the 2018 hit "Halloween". It follows Michael Myers as he returns to Haddonfield to kill more people. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect "Halloween Kills" to be just as good, if not better.

5) "Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot"

This movie is a reboot of the 1984 classic "Nightmare on Elm Street". It follows Nancy Thompson as she confronts her worst nightmare: Freddy Krueger. The original movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect the reboot to be just as good, if not better
