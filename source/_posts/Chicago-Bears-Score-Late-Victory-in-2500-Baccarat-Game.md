#  Chicago Bears Score Late Victory in 2500 Baccarat Game

The Chicago Bears were down by two points with only a few minutes left in their 2500 Baccarat game against the AFC East divisional leaders, the New England Patriots. After a costly interception thrown by Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, the Patriots were looking to seal the victory and maintain their unbeaten record.

However, Cutler led the Bears on an improbable comeback drive, capped off by a touchdown pass to receiver Alshon Jeffery with only seconds remaining on the clock. The Bears went on to win the game 27-24 and improve their record to 5-3.

It was a hard-fought victory for the Bears, who had trailed for most of the game. "We never gave up," said Cutler after the game. "Our defense played great today, and our offense stepped up when we needed it."

The Patriots (7-0) were not happy with the outcome of the game. "We're very disappointed," said coach Bill Belichick. "We thought we had this one in hand."

The Bears will look to build on their momentum from this victory as they head into their next game against the Miami Dolphins.
