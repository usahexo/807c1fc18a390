#  How Does Bingo Work at an Online Casino?

There are different variations of the game of bingo. In one version, called coverall, players try to cover all the squares on their cards with numbers called by the caller. In another version, called blackout, players aim to fill all 25 squares on their card with numbers called by the caller.



Players mark off numbers as they are called until one player has either covered all of his or her squares on the card or has marked off a pre-determined pattern, such as a line or a block. That player then yells “Bingo!”, and is declared the winner.



The game can be played with either one or multiple cards, depending on the casino. Typically, a player will buy six cards at a time and will be able to daub (mark off) numbers on each card with a pen or highlighter. Alternatively, some casinos offer an electronic version of the game in which players mark off numbers electronically.



When playing online bingo, the caller is not actually calling out numbers; rather, computer software randomly generates combinations of numbers which are displayed in numbered balls below the screen. Players then select which number they believe is being called and daub it off their card accordingly. 



The game progresses as normal until one player wins by covering all their squares or completing a predetermined pattern. At this point, that player is declared the winner and is awarded any prizes that may be associated with that particular game variation.

Once you have chosen a game, you will need to select a card. Cards come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the game you are playing. In classic bingo, for example, cards are typically 5x5 grids with 24 squares in total. In 90-ball and 75-ball bingo, cards are typically 3x9 grids with 27 squares in total.
