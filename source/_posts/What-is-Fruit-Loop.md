#  What is Fruit Loop?

A fruit loop is a sweetened breakfast cereal that is made from loops of dough that are shaped into a ring and then baked. The dough is often flavored with sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Fruit loops are one of the most popular breakfast cereals in the United States.

The cereal was created by General Mills in 1963 and was originally called "Olympic Rings." The name was changed to "Fruit Loops" in 1967. The cereal was also marketed under the names "Crazy Quilt" and "Rainbow Brite."

The original recipe for Fruit Loops called for white flour, corn starch, sugar, salt, malted barley flour, trisodium phosphate, annatto extract (for color), sodium bicarbonate, and monocalcium phosphate.

Today, the ingredients list for Fruit Loops includes enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), sugar, corn syrup solids, oat hulls (1%), malt flavorings (barley malt extract, natural vanilla flavor), canola oil, citric acid (for tartness), beta-carotene (for color), salt, calcium carbonate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), zinc oxide (a mineral nutrient), and iron lactate.
