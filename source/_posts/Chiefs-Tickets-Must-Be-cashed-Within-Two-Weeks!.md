#  Chiefs Tickets Must Be cashed Within Two Weeks!

If you are a season ticket holder for the Chiefs, and cannot attend the game on December 3 against the Jets, be sure to cash in your tickets no later than November 27. After this date, any unsold tickets will become invalid and will not be honored at the gate.

This is just one of the many changes that have been made to the ticketing policy for the 2017-2018 season. Previously, tickets could be cashed in up until kickoff of the game. However, due to increasing demand for tickets, the team has had to make some adjustments in order to ensure that as many fans as possible have an opportunity to attend a game.

For those who are unable to attend a game but would still like to have their tickets valid, you can donate them back to the team in exchange for a tax deduction. This option is available through Ticketmaster or by calling (816) 920-9400.

So be sure to review the Chiefs' website for all of the latest ticketing information, and get your tickets cashed in before it's too late!
