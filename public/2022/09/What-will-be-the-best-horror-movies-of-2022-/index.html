They were also well-received by critics and fans alike. This year, we are expecting even more great horror movies. So, what will be the best horror movies of 2022?</p>
<p>Here are five horror movies that we think will be the best of 2022:</p>
<ol>
<li>“It: Chapter Two”</li>
</ol>
<p>This movie is a sequel to the 2017 hit “It”. It follows the same characters as they confront their biggest fears as adults. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect “It: Chapter Two” to be just as good, if not better.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“The Conjuring 3”</li>
</ol>
<p>The Conjuring series is one of the most successful horror franchises of all time. The first two movies were both box office successes and received critical acclaim. We expect the third movie to be just as good, if not better. It follows Ed and Lorraine Warren as they investigate a case that is based on real-life events.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“A Quiet Place 2”</li>
</ol>
<p>This movie is a sequel to the 2018 hit “A Quiet Place”. It follows the same characters as they try to survive in a world where monsters hunt by sound. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect “A Quiet Place 2” to be just as good, if not better.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Halloween Kills”</li>
</ol>
<p>This movie is a sequel to the 2018 hit “Halloween”. It follows Michael Myers as he returns to Haddonfield to kill more people. The first movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect “Halloween Kills” to be just as good, if not better.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>“Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot”</li>
</ol>
<p>This movie is a reboot of the 1984 classic “Nightmare on Elm Street”. It follows Nancy Thompson as she confronts her worst nightmare: Freddy Krueger. The original movie was praised for its scares, acting, and direction. We expect the reboot to be just as good, if not better</p>

But what is the latest news on horror movies? What new films are coming out that will terrify audiences?</p>
<p>One film to watch out for is “A Quiet Place”. The plot revolves around a family who must live in silence in order to avoid being killed by monsters that hunt by sound. This film is directed by John Krasinski, who is also starring in the movie alongside his wife, Emily Blunt.</p>
<p>Another upcoming horror movie is “Suspiria”. The original 1977 film was directed by Dario Argento and was considered to be one of the most shocking and violent horror movies ever made. This new version, directed by Luca Guadagnino, promises to be just as creepy and intense.</p>
<p>And finally, there is “Halloween”, which is a sequel to the classic 1978 slasher film. The new movie will be directed by David Gordon Green and will star Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who will finally have her revenge on Michael Myers.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many horror movies that are coming out in 2018. Whether you’re a fan of slashers, zombies, or psychological thrillers, there’s something for everyone this year. So get ready to be scared!</p>

Why do people love to be scared?</p>
<p>There are many possible explanations, but one of the most common reasons is that horror movies give people a sense of release. They allow people to experience fear in a controlled setting, and then quickly return to reality.</p>
