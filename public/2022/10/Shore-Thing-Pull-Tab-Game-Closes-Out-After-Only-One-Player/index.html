<p>The game, which was supposed to last for six weeks, only saw one player make it to the final round. That player, Pete Benson, walked away with the $1,000 prize.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad I could be the one to win,” said Benson. “I’m sure the other contestants were just as eager to win as I was.”</p>
<p>When asked about what he plans to do with the prize money, Benson said he’s going to use it to pay some bills and put some money away for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Despite being a one-player game, Shore Thing generated a lot of excitement in the small town of Shore Thing. Many people were hoping to be the lucky contestant who walked away with the cash prize.</p>
<p>“I’m really disappointed that the game didn’t last longer,” said Barbara Walters, a local resident. “But I’m glad someone was able to win it.”</p>

<p>According to witnesses, the game had been going on without any problems when suddenly the screen went blank and a message appeared stating that the game was closed due to a fatal error.</p>
<p>No explanation has yet been given for the cause of the error, and officials from the casino refused to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Many players were left frustrated and angry by the sudden closure of the game, which cost some of them money that they had already won.</p>

<p>Patrons were just starting to get into the groove of the new game when, apparently with no warning, all the tabs popped open and paid out. According to witnesses, there was utter pandemonium as people scrambled to collect their winnings.</p>
<p>“It was insane,” said one player. “I’d just won like $40 and then suddenly I had $240. I thought I was going to break the machine!”</p>
<p>In the end, no one seemed to really benefit from the glitch. The casino has yet to make a statement about what happened or when – if ever – the game will be back up and running.</p>

The game is unavailable as of Saturday, July 21st due to a problem with the software that powers it. The issue is believed to be related to how the game communicates with the casino’s central computer system.</p>
<p>A statement from casino management reads, in part:</p>
<p>“We are aware of the issue and are doing everything we can to fix it as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our customers.”</p>
<p>The game is one of several offered by the casino and typically sees average crowds of 50-60 people per day. Players purchase pull tabs for $1 each and have a chance to win prizes up to $1,000.</p>

<p>The Shore Thing Pull Tab game, which is played by pulling tabs off of beer cans and collecting points for each one, stopped functioning properly shortly after the start of the game on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I’ve been playing this game for years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” said one player. “We were all just standing there trying to figure out what was going on.”</p>
<p>Players were eventually informed that the game was being shut down due to the software issue. It is unclear when or if the game will resume.</p>
