Look no further, this guide has everything you need to know!</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to clear all the evil goblins from the screen. To do this, you must use bombs to blast them away. You can place bombs by tapping and holding on the screen. Bomb placement is key, as you want to make sure that as many goblins as possible are hit by each bomb.</p>
<p>There are three types of goblins - red, green, and blue - and each type is susceptible to a different type of bomb. Reds take damage from fire bombs, greens take damage from water bombs, and blues take damage from air bombs. In order to beat the game, you’ll need to figure out which type of bomb is most effective against each type of goblin.</p>
<p>In general, it’s best to start with the easier goblins first and work your way up to the harder ones. There are six rounds in all, and each round gets harder than the last. As you progress through the rounds, you’ll encounter more and more difficult goblins.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for winning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try not to place bombs too close together, as this can lead to wasted bombs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use bombs sparingly - it’s better to save them for when they’re needed most.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Strategically place your bombs so that as many goblins as possible are hit by each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>

In this guide, I will share with you some tips and tricks that I have learned from playing the game. So, without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li>Always use your bombs wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing ‘Evil Goblins xBomb’ is to use your bombs wisely. Try to save them for when you really need them, as they can be quite powerful weapons.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the terrain before bombing</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing to remember is to always check the terrain before bombing. This is especially important when there are enemy goblins around, as you don’t want to bomb your own troops by accident!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use your troops wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is how to best use your troops. For example, it might be a good idea to put your archers in the back so they can shoot enemies from a distance. Meanwhile, your melee troops can be placed in the front so they can take on the enemy head-on.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use spells wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, another thing to keep in mind is how to best use your spells. For example, you might want to use a spell like ‘Freeze’ when there are a lot of enemies around, as it will temporarily immobilize them and make them easier to kill.</p>
<h1 id="Advanced-Strategies-for-Winning-at-‘Evil-Goblins-xBomb’-on-PC"><a href="#Advanced-Strategies-for-Winning-at-‘Evil-Goblins-xBomb’-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Strategies for Winning at ‘Evil Goblins xBomb’ on PC"></a>Advanced Strategies for Winning at ‘Evil Goblins xBomb’ on PC</h1><p>A bomb game, Evil Goblins xBomb (EGxB) on PC is a popular choice these days for online gamers. The objective of the game is to strategically place bombs to eliminate all the evil goblins on the board. If you’re not careful, you can easily lose the game by letting the goblins jump on your bombs!</p>
<p>There are different ways to play EGxB, and there are also different advanced strategies that can help you win. In this article, we will discuss some of these advanced strategies.</p>
<p>The first strategy is to always keep your eye on the board. This means that you should always be aware of what is happening and where the goblins are. You don’t want to place a bomb next to a goblin if there is another goblin close by that can easily jump on it!</p>
<p>Secondly, try to cluster your bombs together. This will make it harder for the goblins to jump on them and it will also make it easier for you to detonate them all at once.</p>
<p>Thirdly, always be prepared to detonate your bombs. Don’t wait until the last minute – act quickly and decisively so that the goblins don’t have time to react.</p>
<p>Fourthly, use your environment to your advantage. If there is a large rock or a tree in the middle of the board, use it to block the goblins from getting to your bombs.</p>
<p>Lastly, stay calm and don’t get frustrated if you lose a few games in a row. Just remember that practice makes perfect!</p>

</li>
<li><p>Next, head over to the area where the fire-breathing dragon is located and take it down! This will make the battle much easier.</p>
</li>
